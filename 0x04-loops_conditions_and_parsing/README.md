### Shellcheck

[Shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) is a tool that helps ensure proper Bash script quality. It provides recommendations on syntax and semantics and advice on edge cases. It is essential that all Bash scripts pass Shellcheck without any errors.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Create a SSH RSA key pair

This script generates an SSH RSA key pair, shares the public key, and fills the SSH public key field of your intranet profile.

### Task 1: For Best School loop

A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a for loop.

### Task 2: While Best School loop

A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using a while loop.

### Task 3: Until Best School loop

A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times using an until loop.

### Task 4: If 9, say Hi!

A Bash script that displays "Best School" 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, it displays "Hi" on a new line.

### Task 5: 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance

A Bash script that displays messages based on the iteration number. It displays "bad luck" for the 4th loop iteration, "good luck" for the 8th loop iteration, and "Best School" for the other iterations.

### Task 6: Superstitious numbers

A Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and specific messages based on the iteration number. It displays "4" and "bad luck from China" for the 4th loop iteration, "9" and "bad luck from Japan" for the 9th loop iteration, and "17" and "bad luck from Italy" for the 17th loop iteration.

### Task 7: Clock

A Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes. It displays hours from 0 to 12 and minutes from 1 to 59.

### Task 8: For ls

A Bash script that displays the content of the current directory in a list format, showing only the part of the name after the first dash.

### Task 9: To file, or not to file

A Bash script that checks the existence of the "school" file and provides information about it. It checks if the file exists, if it's empty or not, and if it's a regular file.

### Task 10: FizzBuzz

A Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100 with specific conditions. It displays "FizzBuzz" when the number is a multiple of 3 and 5, "Fizz" when it's a multiple of 3, "Buzz" when it's a multiple of 5, and the number itself otherwise.
