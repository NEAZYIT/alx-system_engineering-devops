## Tasks

### 0. OSI Model

- OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design.
- The OSI model is organized from the lowest level (layer 1) for physical transmission to the highest level (layer 7) for application-specific communication.
- This project mainly focuses on the Transport layer (TCP/UDP) and the Network layer (IP and ICMP).

### 1. Types of Network

- Local Area Networks (LAN) connect local devices together.
- Wide Area Networks (WAN) connect LANs together, often operating over the Internet.
- Answer questions about network types and their applications.

### 2. MAC and IP Address

- Learn about MAC (Media Access Control) and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses.
- Answer questions related to MAC and IP addresses.

### 3. UDP and TCP

- Understand the differences between UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).
- Answer questions about the characteristics of UDP and TCP.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports

- Explore the concept of ports in network communication.
- Learn about common port numbers for services like SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
- Write a Bash script to display listening ports.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network

- Write a Bash script that uses ICMP to ping an IP address passed as an argument.
- Accept a string as an argument and ping the IP 5 times. 
- Display usage instructions if no argument is passed.
